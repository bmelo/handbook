------------------

The following are a list of blogs and online resources that might be helpful as you embark on your own fMRI journey!

* `AFNI Bootcamp <https://www.youtube.com/c/AFNIBootcamp>`_
	A collection of YouTube videos that describe the theory/concepts of processing neuroimaging data using AFNI. It also shows hand-on usage of the graphical tools in the AFNI software package.
* `Andy's Brain Blog <https://www.andysbrainblog.com/>`_
	A blog by Dr. Andrew "Andy" Jahn where he posts tutorials and videos after neuroimaging analysis from start to finish! Importantly, he covers a range of popular software packages (e.g., AFNI, SPM, FSL).
* `BrainIAK <https://brainiak.org/>`_
	Brain Imaging Analysis Kit, or BrainIAK, is an open-source Python software that applies advanced machine learning methods and high-performance computing to analyzing neuroimaging data. It is tightly integrated with SciKit-Learn and includes lots of modules, from multi-voxel pattern analysis to topographic factor analysis and more! This was created in a collaborate between Intel and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. 
* `Meta-Resource of Meta-Resources for Cognitive Neuroscience <https://meta-meta-resources.org/>`_
	This isn't *Inception* but instead a useful took that centralizes recourses for cognitive neuroscience research. It has everything from free online tutorials/courses you can go through to funding opportunities and summer schools/workshops you can apply for and so much more!
* `Mumford Brain Stats <https://mumfordbrainstats.tumblr.com/>`_
	A tumblr maintained by Dr. Jeanette Mumford where she answers questions about the statistical analysis of neuroimaging data. She also has a `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7gF0zm35FwrFpDND6DWeA>`_ with short video tutorials and lessons about different neuroimaging data analysis strategies.
* `Neuroimaging Analysis Methods for Naturalistic Data <http://naturalistic-data.org/>`_
	An online book developed by folks at Dartmouth College (Drs. Luke Chang, Emily Finn, and Jeremy Manning) in collaboration with a lot of other cool people. It includes a collection of the state-of-the-art techniques used in analyzing naturalistic data, such as films or stories.
